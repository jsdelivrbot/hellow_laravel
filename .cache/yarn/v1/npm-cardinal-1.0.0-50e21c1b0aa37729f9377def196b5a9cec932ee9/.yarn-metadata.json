In these cases the line is printed to the terminal without\nhighlighting it.\n\n### Theme\n\nThe default theme will be used for highlighting.\n\nTo use a different theme, include a `.cardinalrc` file in your `HOME` directory.\n\nThis is a JSON file of the following form:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"theme\": \"hide-semicolons\",\n  \"linenos\": true|false\n}\n```\n\n- `theme` can be the name of any of the [built-in themes](https://github.com/thlorenz/cardinal/tree/master/themes) or the\nfull path to a custom theme anywhere on your computer.\n- linenos toggles line number printing\n\n## API\n\n### *highlight(code[, opts])*\n\n- returns the highlighted version of the passed code ({String}) or throws an error if it was not able to parse it\n- opts (see below)\n\n### *highlightFileSync(fullPath[, opts])*\n\n- returns the highlighted version of the file whose fullPath ({String}) was passed or throws an error if it was not able\n  to parse it\n- opts (see below)\n\n### *highlightFile(fullPath[, opts], callback)*\n\n- calls back with the highlighted version of the file whose fullPath ({String}) was passed or with an error if it was not able\n  to parse it\n- opts (see below)\n- `callback` ({Function}) has the following signature: `function (err, highlighted) { .. }`\n\n### opts\n\nopts is an {Object} with the following properties:\n\n- `theme` {Object} is used to optionally override the theme used to highlight\n- `linenos` {Boolean} if `true` line numbers are included in the highlighted code\n- `firstline` {Integer} sets line number of the first line when line numbers are printed\n\n**Note** The `json` option is obsoleted and not necessary anymore as cardinal properly understands both JSON and JavaScript.\n\n## Examples ([*browse*](https://github.com/thlorenz/cardinal/tree/master/examples))\n\n- [sample .cardinalrc](https://github.com/thlorenz/cardinal/blob/master/examples/.cardinalrc)\n- [highlighting a code snippet](https://github.com/thlorenz/cardinal/blob/master/examples/highlight-string.js) via\n  ***highlight()***\n- [file that highlights itself](https://github.com/thlorenz/cardinal/blob/master/examples/highlight-self.js) via\n  ***highlightFile()*** including line numbers\n- [file that highlights itself hiding all\n  semicolons](https://github.com/thlorenz/cardinal/blob/master/examples/highlight-self-hide-semicolons.js) via\n  ***highlightFileSync()***\n",
